# DeFi Aggregator Protocol

## Project Description
A minimal smart contract that acts as a DeFi Aggregator, allowing users to perform token swaps across multiple DEXs through a single interface. This contract simplifies and streamlines user interaction with DeFi protocols.

## Project Vision
To become a unified entry point for users to interact with multiple decentralized exchanges efficiently, saving on gas, slippage, and time, while offering the best possible rates across supported platforms.

## Key Features
- 🔁 **Token Swapping**: Perform token swaps using any integrated DEX via a standard interface.
- 🔐 **Admin Control**: Secure function to recover tokens mistakenly sent to the contract.
- ⚙️ **DEX Interoperability**: Flexible design allowing plug-and-play integration with multiple DEX contracts.

## Future Scope
- 💸 **Best Price Routing**: Implement logic to automatically choose the best price from multiple DEXs.
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Offer real-time metrics for swap volume, gas savings, and top DEXs.
- 🧩 **Yield Optimization**: Integrate yield farming and liquidity provisioning to enhance user returns.
- 🌐 **Cross-chain Support**: Add support for bridging and swapping tokens across multiple blockchains.
